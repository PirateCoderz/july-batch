Hereâ€™s a revised set of JavaScript practice questions without using functions:

 Objects and Object Destructuring

1. Basic Object Creation:
   - Create an object `car` with properties `brand`, `model`, and `year`. Access and print each property.

2. Object Destructuring:
   - Given the following object:
     ```
     const employee = { name: 'John', position: 'Developer', salary: 50000 };
     ```
     Use object destructuring to extract `name` and `salary` and print them to the console.

3. Nested Object Destructuring:
   - Consider the object:
     ```
     const library = {
       name: 'City Library',
       location: {
         city: 'New York',
         state: 'NY',
       },
       booksAvailable: 5000,
     };
     ```
     Use destructuring to extract `city` and `booksAvailable` from the object and log them.

4. Destructuring with Default Values:
   - Given the object:
     ```
     const movie = { title: 'Inception', director: 'Christopher Nolan', releaseYear: 2010 };
     ```
     Destructure `title`, `releaseYear`, and a non-existent property `rating` (set the default value for `rating` as `'Not Rated'`) and print them.

5. Renaming While Destructuring:
   - Using the object:
     ```
     const gadget = { name: 'Smartphone', brand: 'XYZ', price: 899 };
     ```
     Destructure the `name` property and rename it to `deviceName`, and print `deviceName` and `price`.

 Strings and String Methods

6. String Length:
   - Take the string `"JavaScript is awesome!"` and print its length.

7. Substring Extraction:
   - From the string `"Coding is fun"`, extract and print the substring `"fun"` using string methods.

8. String Search:
   - Take the string `"I enjoy learning JavaScript"` and use a method to check if the word `"JavaScript"` is present. Log the result (`true` or `false`).

9. String Replacement:
   - Replace the word `"difficult"` with `"exciting"` in the string `"Learning new concepts is difficult"` and print the updated string.

10. String Case Conversion:
    - Convert the string `"web development"` to uppercase and the string `"PYTHON"` to lowercase, then log both results.

 Combining Objects and Strings

11. Object and String Methods Together:
    - Given the object:
      ```
      const user = { firstName: 'Anna', lastName: 'Johnson', role: 'Designer' };
      ```
      Combine `firstName` and `lastName` to form the full name and convert it to uppercase, then log it.

12. String Search in Object Properties:
    - Given this object:
      ```
      const article = { title: 'Learning JavaScript Basics', description: 'JavaScript is versatile and widely used.' };
      ```
      Use a string method to check if the word `"JavaScript"` is present in both the `title` and `description` properties and log the result (`true` or `false`).

13. Concatenating Strings from Object Properties:
    - Given the object:
      ```
      const animal = { type: 'Dog', breed: 'Golden Retriever', age: 3 };
      ```
      Create a sentence like `"The animal is a 3-year-old Golden Retriever."` using the object properties and log it.

14. Count Characters in an Object Property:
    - Given the object:
      ```
      const book = { title: 'War and Peace', author: 'Leo Tolstoy' };
      ```
      Count the number of characters in the `title` property and print the result.
